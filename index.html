         <br><br>
         <h1>Even if you've never made any money online before…</h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>And do so in record time, without having to invest any money upfront or have any previous business experience…</h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1> <strong class="yellowText">Then this will be the most important program you'll ever watch.</strong></h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>Here’s why:</h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>My name is Muhammad Haroon and a few years ago <span>I had nothing.</span></h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>I was living with my single mom and we were surviving off of government benefits…</h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>I had just jumped into the online business world, with a dream to make it big online to get us out of that situation.</h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>I was 16 and had no one to guide me…</h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>It was also at that time that I decided to drop out of high school.</h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>I basically had all the odds stacked against me.</h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>I went on to spend months trying to find the perfect online business model…</h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>Sales funnels.</h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>Dropshipping.</h1>

         <h1>Online apps.</h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>You name it…</h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>I've <span>tried them all, to no avail.</span></h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>All I'd do was spend 12 to 16h every single day bumping my head against the wall trying to make this "online business" thing work…</h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>Only to get hit with a different blow every time.</h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>It was like that for long months…</h1>
         <br><br>
         <h1>Until I made a <span>small yet extremely effective change</span> to my approach…</h1>

        <h1>What took me from a high school dropout to one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world in my age range?</h1>

        <br><br>
        <h1>You see…</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>During the last few years, a lot of people have tried to replicate my steps.</h1>
        <br><br>
        <ul class="custom-list2">
            <li><h1>They have tried to work with clients</h1></li>

            <li><h1>They have tried to go viral on TikTok</h1></li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h1>But, at the end of the day…</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>There are only a handful of 23-year-olds out there with a multi-8-figure net worth.</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>And I'm not talking about one specific person here…</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>I'm talking about <span>dozens of thousands of people</span> trying to replicate my exact steps.<h1>
        <br>
        <h1>Now, the question is:</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>What is the <span>difference between the ones that do achieve success</span> like me…</span></h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>And the <span>ones who do not?</span></h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>If they're all doing the exact same thing as I did, why only very few of them succeed?</h1>
        <br><br>
        <strong class="boldHeading3">THE "SMALL YET EFFECTIVE CHANGE" YOU NEED...</strong>
        <br><br>
        <h1>And what I've discovered is this:</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Most people think that they're not succeeding because there's some sort of <span>"secret information" they haven't yet discovered…</span></h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Something that they don't know yet that, when they discover it...</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>...will lead them to success.</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>And they think that the lack of such "knowledge" is <span>why they haven't succeeded.</span></h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Maybe you believe that yourself.</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Now, the reality is:</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>That couldn't be <span>further from the truth.</span></h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>For most of you, the reason you're not succeeding is not because of what you're <span>NOT doing…</span></h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>But because of what you <span>ARE doing.</span></h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>You see…</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Most things that you ARE doing are keeping you stuck where you're currently at.</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>And the truth is:</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>‍<span class="yellowText2">You're not at the top 10% because you're doing things that keep you at the bottom.</span> </h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>And that's extremely dangerous…</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Why?</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Because you keep doing the things that you THINK are moving you forward…</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>When in reality they're only moving you further and further away from your goals.</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>And the more you do them…</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>The further away you get.</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Which means:</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>You need to address those actions <span>as soon as possible.</span></h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>‍Because the more you wait, the harder it will be to fix them. </h1>
        <br><br>

   <br><br>
   <p>How?</p>
   <br><br>
   <p>I'm giving you 3 full-blown programs worth $1,500 each:</p>
   <br><br>
   <img src="images/entrepreneur.webp" alt="">
   <br><br>
   <p>Each one of these programs is from 8h to 20h long.</p>
   <br><br>
   <p>And for every single one of those programs, you're going to be learning from someone who has made millions with that specific method.</p>
   <br><br>
   <ul class="custom-line5">
    <li><p><span>For Copywriting</span>, you'll get Pen To Profit, from my own CMO Luis Berger.
        <br><br>
        There, you'll learn how to write emails, ads and sales copy that clients pay thousands of dollars for.
        <br><br>
        All of it using AI and proven fill-in-the-blank copywriting structures that Luis will share with you.
    </p></li>
    <br><br>
    <li><p><span>For Organic Ecommerce,</span> we just finished recording a brand new program from my good friend Jordan Welch.
        <br><br>
        Inside of it he teaches you how to put together a Shopify store from scratch and optimize the right details to ensure you get as many sales as possible.
        <br><br>
        Then, he's gonna show you exactly how to get your first $1,000 sales organically. You'll literally see him live building a store from scratch and getting sales from it during the program.
        <br><br>
    </p></li>
    <li><p><span>For sales, you'll get 6-Figure Sales Rep,</span> from my sales manager Paul Daley.
        <br><br>
        There, you'll learn how to get good at sales in record time so you can make your first $1,000 as an appointment setter or online sales rep.
    </p></li>
   </ul>
   <br><br>
   <p>And I'm giving them to you… Completely FREE.</p>
   <br><br>
   <p>Most importantly:</p>
   <br><br>
   <p>With these, getting to your first $1,000 becomes a matter of <span>simply executing what your mentors tell you to do.</span></p>
   <br><br>
   <p>If you can follow instructions, you can make your first $1,000 online.</p>

    <h1>Making your first $1,000 <br> becomes a simple task when you have this…</h1>
    <img src="images/Images2.webp" alt="">
    <br><br>
    <p>Here's what you need to understand:</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Making your first $1,000 online is not a sprint…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>It's a marathon. </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>That's why Digital Launchpad is broken down into months.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>You see…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>It becomes incredibly easy to make your first $1,000 <span>once you have the right guidance.</span></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>All you need is:</p>
    <br><br>
    <ul class="custom-list4">
        <!-- <li><p>To have the right guidance...‍</p></li>
        <li>To execute the right actions...</li>
        <li>And then, succeed.</li> -->
        <li><p>To have <span>the right guidance...‍</span></p></li>
        <br>
        <li><p>To execute <span>the right actions...</span></p></li>
        <br>
        <li><p>And then, <span>succeed.</span></p></li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <p>It is as simple as that…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>The problem is:</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>For some people it might take 2 weeks to achieve such success…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>For some people it might take 2 weeks to achieve such success…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>For others, it might take 3 months.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>That's why you need <span>continuous guidance.</span></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>One thing is for sure:</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>You'll face roadblocks along the way.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>And, most likely,<span> you won't know how to handle them</span>, since you've never experienced it before.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>So when you encounter those roadblocks, it is essential that you have the right guidance.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Someone who will show you the way…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>…And tell you what to execute.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>And that's why...</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I made Digital Launchpad a <span>continuous monthly subscription.</span></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>For you to have continuous guidance until you reach the <span>ultimate goal of the program:</span></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Making your first $1,000 online.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>And it doesn't matter if it takes 1 week or 3 months…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p><span class="yellowText">You'll have our support the entire way through.</span></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Here's the thing:</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I've built Digital Launchpad not for it to be a program that you watch once and you're done…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>But to be a platform that you keep going back to whenever you face a roadblock…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>…Until you make your first $1,000.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>And<span> we don't stop until you get there.</span></p>

    <h1>If you haven't YET found success, it's not your fault…</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>Look, I genuinely empathize with you.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>You're not not where you want to be in life…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>And it is <span>NOT your fault.</span></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Because here's the thing:</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>You go on YouTube and one person is telling you to do X…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Then, you watch another video telling you to do Y instead, because X doesn't actually work…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>And then the next video, someone else tells you the exact opposite.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>They all give you <span>conflicting advice.</span></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>One person says that dropshipping is the way to go.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>The other person is telling you that trading is the secret opportunity that you're missing… </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>And at the end…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>You're <span>left more confused</span> than when you first started. </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>The truth is:</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>All you need is to have one person talk honestly to you.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>And here's the thing:</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Inside of Digital Launchpad I can be completely honest with you as to what works and what doesn't.</p>

    <h1>Why Am I Offering You Such Opportunity For So Cheap?</h1>
    <img src="images/currency.webp" alt="">
    <br><br>
    <p>Here's the thing…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>The <span>more people you help, the more money you make.</span></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>And since I want to make a lot of money with Educate…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I need to help <span>a lot </span> of people.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>That's why Inside of Digital Launchpad you're gonna get <span class="yellowText">content more valuable than most people have inside their $2,000 programs.</span></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>The truth is:</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I have one of the largest audiences in the online space…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>And throughout my entire career I've focused on helping a <span>very small fraction</span> of this audience with my paid programs.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>And I did that on purpose.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Because I take pride on my programs holding the <span>record for the best student results</span> in the industry.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>And if I want to keep this record...</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I need to work with people that I know I can help.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>That's why my flagship program, Agency Navigator, is priced at $1,500.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Because, realistically, if you haven't made your first $1,500- you'll struggle to go all the way from 0 to $10,000/month.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>And to be completely transparent with you…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Agency Navigator is where I <span>really</span> make money with Educate.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>So if my objective is to make the most money…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I need to get as many people as possible to be able to afford these $1,500.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>And I know that for the vast majority of my audience, that price is beyond reach.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>And that's why I created Digital Launchpad.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Here's the deal:</p>
    <br><br>
    <p><span>‍I don't want to make ANY money with this program.</span></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>‍I just want this to be accessible to <span>EVERYONE…</span></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>So that as many people as possible can make their first $1,000 online and be able to afford Agency Navigator.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>That's my secret motive behind Digital Launchpad.</p>
